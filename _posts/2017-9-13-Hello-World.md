So, this is my first post here!

For the moment, I don't have anything prepare for starting today, just setting this space up.

But, as I'm a superb cool guy, I will share some of my favorite podcasts about **digital marketing**:

[The Digital Analytics Power Hour](http://analyticsdemystified.com/blog/tim-wilson/)
I wanna be like Tim Wilson. That's the reason. The man is a beast when talking about Digital Analytics, it's really worth listening.

[Six Pixels of Separation](http://sixpixels.mirumagency.com/podcast/)
Mitch Joel is a visionary. The Mirum Agency CEO has a deep knowledge on the digital marketing world, way beyond the reducionist views we come across a lot when interneting

[This Old Marketing Podcast](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/pnr-with-this-old-marketing-podcast/)
Have you ever heard the phrase "Content is king"? Yeah, everybody on the Marketing area did. So yeah... these two guys, Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose, are the Kings of content. It's smart, fun and has lots of good information.

There's a lot more to listen, such as "SEO Podcast â€“ Unknown Secrets of Internet Marketing", "Marketing for Founders", "Mixergy" and many others.

Maybe it's a series of posts?

So, thanks for bearing with me here, and see ya later!
