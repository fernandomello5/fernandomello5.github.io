So, this is my first post here!

For the moment, I don't have anything prepared for starting today, just setting this space up.



But, as I'm a superb cool guy, I will share some of my favorite podcasts about **digital marketing**:

**[The Digital Analytics Power Hour](http://analyticsdemystified.com/blog/tim-wilson/)**

I wanna be like Tim Wilson. That's the main reason for this podcast to be here. The man is a beast when talking about Digital Analytics, it's really worth listening.

**[Six Pixels of Separation](http://sixpixels.mirumagency.com/podcast/)**

Mitch Joel is a visionary. The Mirum Agency CEO has a deep knowledge on the digital marketing world, way beyond the reducionist views we come across a lot when surfing around (looking at you VDB, shame on you!).

**[This Old Marketing Podcast](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/pnr-with-this-old-marketing-podcast/)**

Have you ever heard the phrase "Content is king"? Yeah, everybody on the Marketing area did. So yeah... these two guys, Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose, are the Kings of content. It's smart, fun and has lots of good information.

There's a lot more to listen, such as **"SEO Podcast â€“ Unknown Secrets of Internet Marketing"**, **"Marketing for Founders"**, **"Mixergy"** and many others.

Maybe it's a series of posts? Do you like this selection?

Send me an email or contact me and we'll discuss further!

Thanks for joining in and see you next time!
