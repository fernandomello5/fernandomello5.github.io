Hi! I'm Fernando Mello. 
I'm VERY passionate about digital marketing, marketing analytics, CRO and all things related. This is a space where I wanna talk about the things I've learned along the way, as well things that I wanna test.

### More Information

My professional background is this: I am currently working at bringit.com.br where I'm a Marketing Analyst focused on data analysis.
I am a graduated on Business Management, with specializations on Marketing and Big Data.
As curious as I can be, I also have studied Growth Driven Design, Magento, Algorithms, Computer Science and any Google tool that I can put my hands on.
I'm scratching R, so basically many things that I discover I'll publish it here.
