Digital Marketing Specialist & Digital Analytics Professional.

This is a space where I wanna explore the things I've learned along the way.

### More Information

My professional background is this: I am currently working at [bringIT Comércio Eletrônico](bringit.com.br) where I'm a Marketing Analyst focused on data analysis.
I am a graduated on Business Management, with specializations on Marketing and Big Data.
As curious as I can be, I also have studied Growth Driven Design, Magento, Algorithms, Computer Science and any Google tool that I can put my hands on.
I'm scratching R, so basically many things that I discover I'll publish it here.
