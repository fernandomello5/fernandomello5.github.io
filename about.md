**Digital Marketing Specialist & Digital Analytics Professional**.

Welcome to my portfolio!

This is a space where I will show off some of my skills on data analysis focused on digital marketing.


### Background

I am a graduated on Business Management, with specializations on Marketing and Big Data.

As curious as I can be, I also have studied Growth Driven Design, Magento, Algorithms, Computer Science and any Google tool that I can put my hands on.

I'm scratching R, so basically many things that I discover I'll publish it here.
